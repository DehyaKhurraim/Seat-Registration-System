This is a Seat Registration System implemented in C++. The system allows users to register and allocate seats for various events, such as concerts, conferences, or sporting events. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage seat reservations efficiently.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their details such as name, email, and password.

- Event Creation: Administrators can create new events, specifying the event name, date, time, and the number of available seats.

- Seat Reservation: Users can search for events and reserve seats for a particular event. The system keeps track of the available seats and ensures that no seat is double-booked.

- Ticket Generation: After successfully reserving seats, users receive a digital ticket with a unique QR code.

- Event Management: Administrators have the authority to manage events, including viewing the list of attendees, canceling events, and modifying event details.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DehyaKhurraim/Seat-Registration-System.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Seat-Registration-System
   ```

3. Compile the source code:

## Usage

1. Upon launching the application, you will be prompted with a menu where you can choose to either register as a new user or login if you already have an account.

2. After logging in, you will be presented with options to create a new event, search for existing events, or manage events if you have administrative privileges.

3. To create a new event, enter the necessary details such as event name, date, time, and the number of seats available.

4. To search for events, you can enter keywords or filters to narrow down the results. Once you find an event you wish to attend, you can reserve seats based on availability.

5. After successfully reserving seats, a digital ticket will be generated containing event details and a unique QR code.

6. Administrators can manage events by viewing the list of attendees, canceling events, or modifying event details as required.
